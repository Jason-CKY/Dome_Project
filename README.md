## About
![Alt text](./Images/Icons/Architecture.png)
The project objective is to create an immersive and interactive experience using projection onto a dome ceiling.
It uses unity to animate and display images onto the dome. A Raspberry Pi is used as an intermediary for I/O interactions
to peripherals like LED strips and various sensors and buttons to add more interactivity to the dome experience.
